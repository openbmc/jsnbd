      "message": "Hi Przemyslaw,\n\nThanks for the continued work on this. As I mentioned above, I\u0027m okay with switching over to  new infrastructure, as long as you\u0027re okay with taking on maintenance.\n\nA couple of overall notes:\n\n - I\u0027m a little confused to the references to \"legacy mode\"; why is this legacy? Users may not have the context about what is legacy and what isn\u0027t, and the existing nbd code doesn\u0027t implement it anyway (what is it a legacy from?). Perhaps something more descriptive would be useful here, like \"client mode\" vs \"browser mode\" ?\n \n - There seems to be a bit of confusion around build infrastructure: you\u0027re using meson, but the bootstrap.sh references an autotools build, and the README references a CMake build.",
