      "message": "I guess if the `jsnbd` feature is totally removed the appropriate capability should be also removed from webui-vue and bmcweb together.\nAdditionally, I guess there are manufactures that are still using nbd-proxy and I don\u0027t understand why this feature is removing.\nIf nbd-proxy is totally removing, then the repository name was confusing and brings implicit meaning. I guess after the current patch the repository will nether provide `jsnbd` and seems to me will be better to have a new separate repository like \u0027virtual-media\u0027 and the current repository might be removed when the nbp-proxy will be marked as obsolete and each manufacturer will give up of that feature.",
